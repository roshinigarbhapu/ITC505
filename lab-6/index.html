        <p>Addendum: The JavaScript code is tasked with displaying the current date and time in the main
             content area of a webpage and showing the last modified date in the footer.</p>
    <p>I got the current date and time by using JavaScript's Date object. To make this information more
         user-friendly, I next used the toLocaleString() function to convert it into a localized string. 
         The formatted date and time are then displayed in the inner HTML of an element that has the ID 
         interface applied to it. I also got the document's last modified date and put it in the footer 
         by using the document.lastModified attribute.</p>
         <p>The absence of elements with the IDs interface and last-modified in the HTML markup could be
             one such problem. The intended feature would not function correctly as a result, leading to
              JavaScript problems. Making ensuring the HTML document contains these elements with the
               proper IDs is essential to resolving this.</p>
